# There are relation operators and logic.

## Relational operators are symbols to compare two values
## Using this operators we are going to return a boolean value.

# print(menor)
# print(mayor_igual)
# print(menor_igual)
# print(igual)

# Logic operators. 
# Is, not, or.
# With and all the comparations have to be true to get a true.
